string

data type

- series of chars (array) terminated by the null-character (\0)
    - \0 has the numeric value 0, i.e. false (for branching)
- defining a string
    (1) string constant
        - enclosed in double quotation marks
        - enclosed chars plus terminating \0 (provided by compiler) are stored in memory
        - quoted phrase acts as a pointer to where the string is stored (like array-names)
    (2) char array
        - size: num of chars plus 1 (for \0)
            - if omitted, compiler determines array-size (by looking for \0)
        - unused elems are automatically initialized to \0
        - name of array == address of 1st char (see pointer->array)
            - ar == &ar[0]      // same address
            - *(ar+1) == ar[1]  // same val
        - increment-operator is not supported (since name of arr is a constant)
    (3) char pointer
        - unlike char-array, pointer can be incremented
        - since pointer is var on its own, its value (string-address) is mutuable
        - recommended: use `const` to initialize pointer to string literal
            - don't use pointer to a string literal if you plan to alter the string

EXAMPLE
(1)
printf("%s, %c", "joe", *"doe"); // joe, d

(2)
char me[] = "joe";
printf("%c, %c, %c", *me, *(me + 1), me[2]); // j, o, e

(3)
const char *me = "joe";
while (*me != '\0') {
    printf("%c ", *me); // j o e
    me++;
}
