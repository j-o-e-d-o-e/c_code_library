storage class->specifier



(1) auto (default)
    - automatic storage duration
    - only be used in declarations of vars with block-scope
        - which already have automatic storage duration
        - therefore, its main use is only documenting intent
(2) register
    - only be used with vars of block scope
    - puts var into the register storage class
        - which amounts to a request to minimize access-time
        - &-operator not allowed
(3) static
    - static duration for entire program runtime
    - if file-scope: var limited to that one file
    - if block-scope: var can be accessed only within that block
        - val persists between calls
        - by default, initialized to 0
(4) extern
    - indicates that you are declaring a var that has been defined elsewhere
    - if file-scope: referred-to var must have external linkage
    - if block-scope: referred-to var has external or internal linkage

- func can be either external (the default) or static
    - extern: can be accessed by funcs in other files
    - static: can be used only within the defining file
