process->signal



(1) signal() for handling signals (receiving server-side) ("to catch signal")
    - 1st arg: signal (int) to be caught
        - e.g. SIGUSR1 (user-defined) or SIGTERM (termination requested)
    - 2nd arg: pointer to handler-func (takes an int as arg)
        - use SIG_IGN to ignore signal
        - use SIG_DFL to restore the default handler for the signal
(2) raise() for sending signals (calling client-side)
    - arg: signal (int) to be sent
    - if success, returns zero; otherwise, non-zero
- sigaction() (for UNIX)
