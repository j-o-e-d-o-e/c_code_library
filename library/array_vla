array->variable-length



- variable-length array (VLA) allows to use variables for dimensioning an array at runtime
- restrictions
    - cannot be declared in file-scope or as static in block-scope
    - cannot be initialized in a declaration (two separate steps)
- 'variable' means one can use a var to specify dimension
    - length cannot be modified later
    - once created, a VLA keeps the same size
    - still, useful for func to accept arr with different/variable dimensions (instead of constants)

EXAMPLE
int quarters = 4;
int regions = 5;
double sales[regions][quarters]; // a VLA
