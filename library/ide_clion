- project skeleton with make and unity-testing-framework
    - four targets (+all): app, test, memcheck, clean
    - see e.g. ~/prog/c/code_library
- run/debug configurations
    - app/test/memcheck: as native apps
        - target: according to makefile, e.g. memcheck
            - picks up code changes automatically
        - executable: path to bin, e.g. ./bin/memcheck.out
        - for test: add '-v' to program arguments for more info about executed tests
        - since native apps, may be run in debug
            - "Memory View" allows to view raw memory of running process
    - clean: as Makefile target
