struct->funcs



- passing struct to func as
    (1) struct-members
    (2) pointer-to-struct
        - must use &-operator to get address
        - unlike array-name, struct-name is not a synonym for its address
    (3) struct (by value)
        - copy is created in called func
        - therefore, return-val might be needed
- typically, use struct-pointers (2) instead of structs (3) as args for funcs
    - using `const` when needed to protect data from unintended changes
    - passing struct by value most often done only for small data

EXAMPLE
struct account {
    char name[LEN];
    double balance;
} joe = {
        .name = "Joe Doe",
        .balance = 10000
};
(1)
void doubleB(double *b) {
    *b *= 2;
}
doubleB(&joe.balance); // transmit address of member
printf("%s's balance: %.2f\n", joe.name, joe.balance); // 20000.00
(2)
void halveB(struct account *account){
    account->balance /= 2;
}
halveB(&joe);
printf("%s's balance: %.2f\n", joe.name, joe.balance); // 10000.00
(3)
double reduceB(const struct account account, double minus) {
    return account.balance - minus;
}
joe.balance = reduceB(joe, 5000);
printf("%s's balance: %.2f\n", joe.name, joe.balance); // 5000.00
