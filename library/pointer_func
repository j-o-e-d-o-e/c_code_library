pointer->func



- if var in calling func needs to be altered, use pointer to var as arg of called func
    - if called func only needs its val for further calculation, transmit var itself
    - pointers might also be necessary, if callee shall communicate more than one value back

EXAMPLE
// * has two different uses, here:
void interchange(int *u, int *v) {  // 1.stores pointer-to-int
    int tmp = *u;                   // 2.dereferences
    *u = *v;
    *v = tmp;
}

int main(void) {
    int x = 5, y = 10;
    printf("Before: x = %d, y = %d\n", x , y); // Before: x =  5, y = 10
    interchange(&x, &y);
    printf("After : x = %d, y = %d\n", x, y);  // After : x = 10, y =  5

    return 0;
}
