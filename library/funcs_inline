funcs->inline



- func defined with specifier 'inline'
    - causes compiler to replace func call with inline-code
    - may perform some optimizations
- C99/C11 says:
    - making a func inline suggests that calls to the func be as fast as possible
    - the extent to which such suggestions are effective is implementation-defined
- inline-func should be short
