build->CMake



- build-file: CMakeLists.txt
- uses Make under the hood
- setup:
    (1) create build-file: see example below
    (2) create build-dir: mkdir build
    (3) configure: specify source- and build-dir: cmake -S . -B build/
        - generates Makefile, etc. in build-dir
- build: cmake --build build/
    - executes Makefile and outputs executable in build/
    - --clean-first: builds target 'clean' first, then builds
    - alternatively: make -C build/
- execute: ./build/${PROJECT_NAME} (as declared in CMakeLists.txt)
- clean: cmake --build build/ --target clean
- comments
    - single line: #
    - multiline: #[[ ... ]]
- in CMakeCache.txt, absolute paths are saved
    - therefore, do not rename or move build-dir
