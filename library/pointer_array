pointer->array

primer, ch.10

(1) name of array == address of 1st elem
    - same adresses
(2) ar[i] == *(ar + i)
    - same vals
(3) C guarantees that when it allocats space for an array
    - a pointer to the 1st location after the end of the array is a valid pointer

EXAMPLE
(1.1)
flizny == &flizny[0];
(1.2)
dates + 2 == &date[2]
(2)
*(dates + 2) == dates[2]
(3)
int sum(int *arr) {
    int total = 0;
    int *end = arr + SIZE; // *end points to loc after final arr-elem
    while (*arr < *end) total += *arr++;
    return total;
}
