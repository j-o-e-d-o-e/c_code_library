pointer->array

primer, ch.10

(1) name of array == address of 1st elem
    - same adresses
(2) ar[i] == *(ar + i)
    - same vals
(3) C guarantees that when it allocats space for an array
    - a pointer to the 1st location after the end of the array is a valid pointer
(4) declaring array params
    - C interprets `int ar[] to mean the same as `int *ar`
    - that is, `ar` is type pointer-to-int

EXAMPLE
(1.1)
flizny == &flizny[0];
(1.2)
dates + 2 == &date[2]
(2)
*(dates + 2) == dates[2]
(3)
int sum(int *arr) { // equivalent to: int sum(int arr[]) (4)
    int total = 0;
    int *end = arr + SIZE; // *end points to loc after final arr-elem
    while (arr < end) {
        total += *arr;
        arr++;
    }
    return total;
}
