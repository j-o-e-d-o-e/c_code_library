header files

primer, ch.16

suffix: .h
things commonly found in header-files
    - directives (see entry: preprocessor->directives)
    - struct-declarations (see entry: struct)
    - function-prototypes (see entry: function)
    - constants
normally, do not include executable code (goes into source-code-file with .c-suffix)

use header-files to declare external vars to be shared by several files (1)

EXAMPLE
(1)
int status = 0 // source-code-file
extern int status; // associated header-file
