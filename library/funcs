funcs



- given args are copied into params of func
    - given address (&) by caller is assigned to a pointer-param (*)
- param-names in prototype and definition do not need to be the same (1)
    - though, good for readability
- possible to declare funcs without prototype, but should be avoided
    - to be retired in future versions of C

EXAMPLE

int index_of_max(double *a, int size) { // definition
