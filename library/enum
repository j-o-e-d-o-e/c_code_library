    GREEN,
    BLUE
} color = RED;

printf("R: %d, G: %d, B: %u\n", RED, GREEN, BLUE);  // R: 1, G: 2, B: 3
++color;
switch (color) {
    case RED:
        printf("color is red\n");
        break;
    case GREEN:
        printf("color is green\n");                 // color is green
        break;
    case BLUE:
        printf("color is blue\n");
        break;
