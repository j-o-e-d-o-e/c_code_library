(1) random num generators [stdlib.h]
    - rand(), srand()
(2) exit program [stdlib.h]
    - atexit() registers func to be executed when exit() is called
        - arg: pointer-to-func
        - up to 32 funcs are guaranted to be addable (by separate atexit()-calls)
        - registed funcs should take no args (typically, for housekeeping tasks)
    - exit() executes funcs registered by atexit() and does tidying up on its own
        - flushes output streams
        - closes all open streams, temporaray files, etc.
        - returns control to the host-env
        - reports a termination-status to the env
            - 0: success (EXIT_SUCCESS)
            - otherwise: error, e.g. 1 (EXIT_FAILURE)
(3) qsort() (see entry: library->qsort()) [stdlib.h]
(4) assert [assert.h]
    - arg: integer-expression
    - if expression evaluates to false (non-zero), error-message and program terminates
    - to identify ciritical locations in a program where certain conditions should be met
    - #define NDEBUG deactivates all assert()-statements (placed before #include <assert.h>)
(5) memcpy()/memmove() (see entry: char->array functions) [string.h]

EXAMPLE
(2)
void sign_off(void) {
    puts("sign-off");
}
int main(void) {
    atexit(sign_off);
    puts("After @exit(sign_off)");
    exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);
}
// After @exit(sign_off)
// sign-off
(4)
int x = rand();
assert(x != 0);
int y = 3 / x;
printf("res: %d", y);
