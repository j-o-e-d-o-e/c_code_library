printf("Hours since January 1, 1970 = %ld\n", t/3600);
// Hours since January 1, 1970 = 454429
(2)
clock_t c = clock();
printf("Platform's model of processor-clock-cycles = %ld\n", c);
(3)
struct tm me = {
        . tm_year = 2000 ,
        . tm_mon = 1,
        . tm_mday = 1
};
printf("Millenium: %d-%d-%d", me.tm_year, me.tm_mon, me.tm_mday);
// Millenium: 2000-1-1
