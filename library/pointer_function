pointer->func



- if var in calling func needs to be altered, use pointer to var as arg of called func
    - if called func only needs its val for further calculation, transmit var itself
    - pointers might also be necessary, if callee shall communicate more than one value back

EXAMPLE
int main(void) {
    int x = 5, y = 10;
    printf("Originally x = %d and y = %d.\n", x , y); // x == 5, y == 10
    interchange(&x, &y);
    printf("Now x = %d and y = %d.\n", x, y); // x == 10, y == 5
    return 0;
}
// * plays two different roles, here:
void interchange(int *u, int *v) { // 1.creates new pointer-to-int
    int temp;
    temp = *u; // 2.dereferences
    *u = *v;
    *v = temp;
}
